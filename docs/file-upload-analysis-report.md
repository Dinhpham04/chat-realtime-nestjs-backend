# File Upload Disconnection Analysis Report

## 🔍 Issue Analysis

**Reported Issue**: "tôi thấy file chưa upload được đã bị disconnected rồi" (File gets disconnected before upload completion)

## 📋 Current Architecture Review

### ✅ What's Working Well

1. **Controller-Service Alignment**: Both `files.controller.ts` and `chunk-upload.controller.ts` are properly aligned with their respective services
2. **Clean Architecture**: Following SOLID principles with proper separation of concerns
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
4. **Security**: JWT authentication, file validation, Redis token-based downloads
5. **WebSocket Implementation**: Robust FileUploadGateway with connection management

### 🔧 Architecture Components

#### Files Module Structure
```
files/
├── controllers/
│   ├── files.controller.ts ✅ (Aligned with services)
│   └── chunk-upload.controller.ts ✅ (Aligned with services)
├── services/
│   ├── files.service.ts ✅ (Core business logic)
│   ├── chunk-upload.service.ts ✅ (Redis-based chunk management)
│   ├── storage.service.ts ✅ (Local filesystem with Redis tokens)
│   ├── file-validation.service.ts ✅ (Type and size validation)
│   └── redis-download-token.service.ts ✅ (Secure download tokens)
└── interfaces/
    └── upload-file-result.interface.ts ✅ (Proper typing)
```

#### WebSocket Gateway Features
- **Connection Management**: Proper authentication and user tracking
- **Grace Period**: 30-second grace period for reconnection
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 uploads per minute per user
- **Concurrent Upload Limits**: Max 5 concurrent uploads per user
- **Session Management**: Active upload session tracking

## 🚨 Potential Disconnection Causes

### 1. WebSocket Configuration Issues
```typescript
// Current configuration in FileUploadGateway
pingTimeout: 60000, // 60 seconds ping timeout
pingInterval: 25000, // 25 seconds ping interval
maxHttpBufferSize: 10e6, // 10MB max buffer size
```

**Potential Issue**: Long upload times may exceed ping timeout

### 2. File Size Limitations
```typescript
// Current limits
GLOBAL_MAX_FILE_SIZE: Various per file type
CHUNK_SIZE: 5MB per chunk
MAX_SMALL_FILE_SIZE: 10MB for direct upload
```

**Potential Issue**: Large files should use chunked upload but may still timeout

### 3. Network Stability
- No automatic retry mechanism for failed uploads
- No resume capability for interrupted uploads
- Limited error recovery strategies

## 🛠️ Senior Developer Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes

1. **Increase WebSocket Timeouts**
```typescript
// Recommended configuration for file uploads
pingTimeout: 120000, // 2 minutes for large file uploads
pingInterval: 30000,  // 30 seconds interval
maxHttpBufferSize: 50e6, // 50MB max buffer
```

2. **Add Connection Health Monitoring**
```typescript
// Add to FileUploadGateway
private healthCheckInterval: NodeJS.Timeout;

private startConnectionHealthCheck(client: Socket): void {
    this.healthCheckInterval = setInterval(() => {
        client.emit('ping', { timestamp: Date.now() });
    }, 15000); // Check every 15 seconds
}
```

3. **Implement Upload Recovery**
```typescript
// Add resume capability for interrupted uploads
async resumeUpload(uploadId: string, userId: string): Promise<UploadProgress> {
    const session = await this.chunkUploadService.getUploadProgress(uploadId, userId);
    return session;
}
```

### Architecture Improvements

1. **Add Upload Queue System**
```typescript
interface UploadQueue {
    userId: string;
    uploadId: string;
    priority: 'low' | 'normal' | 'high';
    retryCount: number;
    status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed';
}
```

2. **Implement Exponential Backoff**
```typescript
class UploadRetryService {
    async retryWithBackoff(uploadFn: () => Promise<any>, maxRetries: number = 3): Promise<any> {
        for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
            try {
                return await uploadFn();
            } catch (error) {
                if (attempt === maxRetries) throw error;
                await this.delay(Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000); // Exponential backoff
            }
        }
    }
}
```

3. **Add Upload Analytics**
```typescript
interface UploadMetrics {
    userId: string;
    fileSize: number;
    uploadDuration: number;
    networkSpeed: number;
    errorCount: number;
    disconnectionCount: number;
}
```

## 🎯 Performance Optimizations

### 1. Smart Chunk Size Calculation
```typescript
calculateOptimalChunkSize(fileSize: number, networkSpeed: number): number {
    // Adjust chunk size based on file size and network conditions
    if (fileSize < 50 * 1024 * 1024) return 1024 * 1024; // 1MB for small files
    if (networkSpeed < 1024 * 1024) return 512 * 1024; // 512KB for slow networks
    return 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB for good networks
}
```

### 2. Upload Progress Persistence
```typescript
// Store upload progress in Redis for recovery
await this.redis.setex(
    `upload:progress:${uploadId}`,
    3600, // 1 hour TTL
    JSON.stringify(uploadProgress)
);
```

## 🔒 Security Enhancements

1. **File Upload Rate Limiting**: Already implemented ✅
2. **Virus Scanning Integration**: Consider adding ClamAV
3. **File Content Validation**: Beyond MIME type checking
4. **Upload Token Expiration**: Implement sliding expiration

## 📊 Monitoring & Debugging

### Recommended Logging
```typescript
// Add comprehensive upload logging
this.logger.log(`Upload started: ${uploadId}, size: ${fileSize}, user: ${userId}`);
this.logger.log(`Upload progress: ${uploadId}, ${percentage}% complete`);
this.logger.log(`Upload completed: ${uploadId}, duration: ${duration}ms`);
this.logger.error(`Upload failed: ${uploadId}, error: ${error.message}`);
```
